## Definitions  
* **Front-end Framework**: A collection of flexible, production-ready HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that we can use when we develop websites and applications.   

## Introduction  
Bootstrap is a front end framework that helps speed up the development of responsive websites. It is responsive, which means that your HTML elements will respond to changes in screen size. Best of all, Bootstrap allows designers & developers of all levels to build sites quickly.  

## Files
* **Base CSS**: Global CSS settings, Styling for fundamental HTML elements such as tables, forms, buttons, and images, and the grid system.  
* **Components**: Styles for common reusable components (e.g. jumbotron, glyphicon, thumbnail, and progress bar components).  
* **JavaScript**: jQuery-based JavaScript plugins for interactive elements such as tooltips, modal windows, and carousels (e.g. Scrollspy plugin).    


## Grid system

The grid system is based on a 12-column grid and uses CSS classes to decide the width of each HTML element theyâ€™re applied to.  

### Rules
Rows must be placed within a .container (fixed-width) or `.container-fluid` (full-width) for proper alignment and padding
Use `.row` elements to create horizontal groups of columns
Content should be placed within columns, and only columns may be immediate children of rows.
