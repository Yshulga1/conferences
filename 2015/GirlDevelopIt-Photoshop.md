## Introductions
* Presenter: [Karly Anderson](https://twitter.com/karlya8)
* [Presentation Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ggeVIvIU1zH0fcW5HAW6msI_pToQReHyTeV6Vkzy0YY)

## Vocabulary
* **_PSD:_** File extension for Photoshop files.
* **_Photoshop Elements_**: A good tool for photography, not as elaborate at Photoshop.  
* **_Raster:_** Dot/pixel-based graphics. Raster graphics cannot resize without quality loss. Photoshop uses raster graphics. Most commonly, rasters are in GIF, JPG, or PNG formats.     
* **_Vector:_**  Math-based, and uses geometry to create graphics. Infinitely resize or scale while maintaining a graphic's quality. Illustrator uses vector graphics. Most commonly, vectors are in SVG formats.  
* **_Pixel:_** Short form of two words, "picture element".  They are the building blocks of any digital photo or image.  
* **_Duplicate Layer:_** A copy/duplicate of the original. **Note:** This is a best practice in Photoshop to keep existing files and edited files separated. Make this part of your workflow!
* **_Smart Guides:_** Align items more effectively while designing. The new smart guides display the spaces between your element, on by default, and show themselves when needed!  
* **_Layer Mask:_** The capability to selectively modify the opacity (transparency) of the layer.  
* **_Adjustment Layer:_** Apply color and tonal adjustments to an image without permanently changing pixel values.
* **_Layer Style:_** Apply effects to a layer. Click the eye to turn it on/off. Double-click `effects` to open the `Layer Styles` options.
* **_Layer Mask:_** Allows you to show/reveal portions of an image.
* **_Smart Object:_** A special layer type/container that can hold one, or multiple layers, vectors for Illustrator, raw files, video, 3D or many other types of objects (similar to a div).

## Raster vs. Vector

## Shortcuts
When in doubt, try the `Shift` or `⌘` keys.

## Print vs. Web
* **Print**: CMYK  
* **Web**: RGB  

## File Types for Web [[Resource](http://www.espressographics.com/text/fileformats.html)]
1. **PNG:** PNG files allow transparency to be set on a scale between opaque and completely transparent, allowing for a faded, translucent look. Some older browsers may have trouble supporting PNG files because of alpha-channels. PNG images are of higher quality. *Best Uses:* Web images such as logos that involve transparency and fading, images in the middle of the editing process, and complex images like photographs if file size is not an issue.
  * **PNG-8:** Very similar to GIF - even smaller than GIF files with 256 colors and 1-bit transparency.
  * **PNG-24:** 24-bit color, similar to JPEG - Can include over 16 million colors. Lossless compression means larger files than JPEG.  

2. **JPEG/JPG:** A standard file format of digital cameras and web pages that can display millions of colors - although does not allow transparency. *Best Uses:* Still images, Real-world photos, and complex coloring/shading of light and dark.
  * Uses a very complex compression algorithm to reduce file size
  * Let image details be “forgotten” and then fill in when displayed
Called “lossy” compression for the lost data.
  * Use when a small file size is more important than maximum quality.

3. **GIF:** Uses 256 indexed colors through dithering, a process where two pixel colors combine to make one to reduce number of colors needed, also using lossless compression. Fewer colors means files start even smaller than JPEG. *Best Uses:* Web graphics with few colors, small icons, animations, and simple images.
  * Progressive loading shows a low-quality version first and then better detail is added.
  * Can be animated
  * Allows for single-bit transparency - one color can be chosen to be transparent.
  * Lower number of colors
  * Reuses colors throughout the image

* `⌘` +`S`
* `Save for Web` (*Legacy in Photoshop CC*), but recommended for optimization (load time).
![save-for-web](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5023024/11200162/24b0df20-8c99-11e5-82b1-d06496b779bd.png)
* [Export artboards, layers, and more](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/export-artboards-layers.html), help article

## Key tools

### Exporting
* Leave the color profile as-is

### Undo
`⌘` + `Z`

### Zoom
* Zoom in: `⌘` +`+`
* Zoom out: `⌘` +`-`

### Move
* `⌘` +`M`

### Rulers/Grids
* `Preferences → Units and Rulers...`
* `⌘` +`R`
* 960/1170 are the most commonly used
* There is a Bootstrap Flexible Column Grid!

### Guides
* `View → Snap to`
* `Preferences → Grids, Guides & Slices`
* `⌘` +`K`

### Magic wand
* Check out the `Sample size` drop-down menu
* Check out the `Tolerance` to select more/less within your project.
* Use `Reselect/Deselect`
* `Shift` adds a selection
* Utilize the `Select inverse` option

### Direct Selection
`⌘` + `A`

### Remove an area
`Alt/option` + `-`

### Lasso
Erasing is destructive, ensure you have made a duplicate layer, and/or are using an embedded image before proceeding.
* **Magnetic Lasso:** Differentiate between a person's head with a landscape background
* **Polygonal Lasso:** POLYGONS!

### Eyedropper/Color sampler

### Crop
* Photoshop remembers your settings, be sure to clear the settings, if necessary.
* Utilize different ruler/grid types.
#### Workflow:
1. Change the image size.  
2. Crop the image to the extent desired.  
3. Change the canvas size to fit the need.  

### Image size `Image → Image size`  

### Hand  

### Rubber band  

### Drawing
* **Brush:** Many different sizes, styles, and hardness' (clarity) levels.  
* **Pencil:** Smaller, more precise, version of brush.  

### Pen (like Illustrator)  
* **Path**  
* **Shape**  
  * Vector-based  
  * Paths  
  * Pixel layers  
* **Path selection**  

## Foreground / Background Colors
Very useful for creating masks. Press `D` to change the foreground and background colors to their default values of black and white, and `X` to switch the current colors.

### Fill a selection/layer:
* Foreground: `⌘`` + 'delete`
* Background: `option/alt` + `delete`

## Layers and Layer Panels [[Resource](http://photoshopcafe.com/tutorials/layers/intro.htm)]
* **Best Practices:** Copy the original image, and keep the background layer locked.
* **Layer mask:** Useful to remove content without deleting (do **_not_** delete content from the original file). Allows you to show/reveal portions of an image.
* **Link layers** together by combining two, or more layers and `link` them. This will keep the layers in sync with each other.
* **Layer Groups** group individual layers together. If you highlight the group, the group will respond similar to linked layers.

![layer-panel-two](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5023024/11200947/81770c38-8c9f-11e5-815a-054c1d25b299.png)

## Image Canvas Size
* **_Good for banners!_**
* Extend the canvas size
* The anchor is based on where you want it to **expand**.
* If you make the canvas size smaller than the current image size, it will crop the image.

## Pixels and Smart Objects

### Pixels
Fully editable, allowing drawing, painting, and/or filling them with colors, or erasing pixels. However, erasing “destroys” pixels, try to use a layer mask instead.


### Smart Objects
An embedded file that appears in its own layer, distinguished by an icon that overlays the thumbnail. They are linked to a source file (e.g., an Illustrator file, JPEG, GIF or other Photoshop file). If you make changes to the source file, the Smart Object layer will also be updated with those changes.

## Embedded and Linked images [[Resource](https://forums.adobe.com/thread/1398884)]

### Linked images
Linked images are linked directly back to the original file. Any changes to the linked image will reflect back to the original file.

*Note*: Linked images can be lost, because their file location can’t be moved without re-linking. If you move the image files the links won’t work anymore, you’ll have to re-link to the new file location, or keep your linked files in the same folder as your .psd.


### Embedded Images
* Once embedded, click `enter`/`return`. The image is considered a *smart object*, meaning it can be edited within Photoshop, and will not alter the original image.
* Become a part of the Photoshop file, where it won’t get lost, but increases the size of the Photoshop file.


### Place
* Adjusts to one set of margins currently displayed in the document (either horizontal or vertical).
* Press `enter` to place the image.
* To resize the image, use **Transform**: `Edit → Transform → Scale`. While resizing, **_always hold down the `shift` key_** to maintain the original object.
* However, smart objects cannot be used in Photoshop until they are **rasterized** (you can always convert back). To rasterize, click `rasterize` on the smart object layer.

## Layer Styles
* Also known as effects (e.g. color overlay, glow, etc.).
* Layer styles can be applied to any object on its own layer by navigating to the bottom of the layers panel and selecting one of the layer styles found under the `fx` icon menu.
* The layer style will be applied to the entirety of that layer, even if it is added to or edited.
* Hold `alt` to copy and duplicate layer styles.
* Combine, duplicate, and/or edit effects to change the appearance of a layer without permanently changing it.

## Layer Adjustments
Apply to a layer, and a new layer is created where any & all layer under the adjustment layer is affected. Useful for tweaking artwork to see how a slightly different tone or contrast might work, without making a permanent change. When you create an adjustment layer, a blank layer mask is also created with it. By brushing on black to the layer mask you can add and remove elements of it, creating some interesting effects in the process.

## Layer Mask
Layer masks (where mask = transparency) are based on the opacity/transparency of a layer based on brush effects. Where layer opacity controls the transparency of the entire layer at once, a mask gives you more precise controls over very specific areas. For instance, if you want the entire layer to be at 30%, you would lower the opacity, or if you want only one portion of a layer to be at 30%, you could use a mask. Layer masks are a good way to hide information, instead of erasing (*which you should never do*).

For example:
![layer-mask](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5023024/11202346/caac13be-8cac-11e5-84c1-1b566f1f468b.png)


### Workflow:
1. Open image
2. Embed another image
3. Ensure black is the primary color (white would show the entire image as-is).
4. Paint!

For example:

## Filters

### Filter Gallery
The filter gallery contains a large majority of major filters, mostly artsy. The filter menu has a more comprehensive list of filters. You can also apply multiple filters and drag them around in your project, and see a preview of many of the special effects filters. Apply multiple filters, turn on/off filter effects, reset options for a filter, and change the order in which filters are applied.

You can use filters to clean up or retouch your photos, apply special art effects that give your image the appearance of a sketch or impressionistic painting, or create unique transformations using distortions and lighting effects.

### Smart Filters
Smart Filters, applied to Smart Objects, let you use filters non-destructively. Smart Filters are stored as layer effects in the `Layers` panel and can be re-adjusted at any time, working from the original image data contained in the Smart Object.

## Shapes

### Making Shapes
The Shape Tool `U` gives you access to standard geometric shapes as well as more complex presets with the `Custom Shape` setting.

* Size, proportion, origin and pixel-snapping, lie hidden inside the drop-down next to the custom shape button in the tool’s property bar.
* Color can be set easily with a double click on the layer!
* Try the pen tool to create custom shapes

### Custom Shapes
* Select a shape tool or a Pen tool.
* Create shapes with the pen tool, and make sure `Shape` is chosen from the `Options` bar menu.
* To choose the color of the shape, click the `Color Swatch` in the `Options` bar, and choose a color from the Color Picker.
* Save custom shapes by clicking on the shape `Define custom shape`.

### The Pen Tool
* Simple to use but difficult to master - **_[Practice](http://bezier.method.ac/)_**!
* It provides a precise method for creating paths, but requires an experienced hand to plot naturally flown curves.

A Few Tips & Tricks:
* Try to use as few points as possible
* Less is more!
* Choose between a `Path` or `Shape`
* Try the `Rubber Band` option, to help you set anchor points with a preview
* The `shift` key can be your friend.

### Circles
* To create a circle, click and hold to go along a curve.

## Type
* Point text vs. Paragraph text
* Crisp/Sharp
* Change text orientation (e.g. horizontal → vertical)
* Faux typing (imitated font uses, like italic)
* **Copy CSS**: `Layer → Copy CSS` You can remove `z-index` and `position` as they relate directly to Photoshop. **_(P.S. This is amazing!)_**   

## Blending Modes and opacity
* Normal
* Multiply (this one is *sweet*)
* Darken
* Screen
* Soft Light
* Overlay
* Lighten
* Contrast
* Inversion
* Cancellation
* Component

## Layer comps
Store everything to revert back, if needed. Particularly useful for different webpages, text levels, or prototypes.

### Saving
The following attribution is saved with Layer comps:
1. Layer visibility
2. Layer position
3. Layer appearance

### Exporting
`File → Export → Layer comps to files`

## Edit Background Fill
* `Edit → Fill`
* Content aware
* If you want to expand the image (copy/paste) into the picture.

## Other stuff to check out
* Cloning
* Check out libraries (new in CC)
* Explore files on the interwebs for inspiration!
